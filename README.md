- 👋 Hi, I’m Cian Doyle
- 🎓 Currently finishing my final year of Computer Science at TUDublin
- 👀 When I'm not busy with college, I like learning about blockchain, cryptography and game reverse engineering / game hacking.
         Some stuff I'm working on:
             - An ethereum based wallet tracker
             - An encrypted messaging app which uses the signum blockchain (https://www.signum.network/) 
- 📫 To get in touch send me an email at ciandoyle64@gmail.com
